My wife and I have multiple lists of things to do and see. When it's time to select something from these lists, we can never decide. It's like trying to decide what to eat when you're already hungry; it all looks good.

What to do?

We put our heads together and designed a small container with 'mailboxes' and an LED under each. We write down stuff on post-its and stuff them in the mailboxes and press the 'choose' button --- we let the computer decide for us.

If you need to randomize the order of a list, then you can keep pulling out selected items and pressing the choose button. It keeps selecting from what's left until there is no more. There are no restrictions on how you load the mailboxes, it looks to see what is there and simply chooses from what is available.
